# UI for the Bishop Fox challenge

Please note, this repository includes a git local repository if you feel curious to see a more detailed work log.

This UI was created using create-react-app and is currently dockerized.
You should only run:

`docker compose up --build`

This command should create an image in your computer and then start a container based on the image.

TODO:
- Would be really nice to have filterable query strings in the table.
- A better user experience when uploading files and redirecting to the dashboard.
